# TDD Telephone

In this exercise you will be writing tests to drive development by another team. You'll be writing Rspec tests -- the other team will be writing code. The final result should be a working Ruby application with full test coverage. At the same time, you will also be writing code for the other team's tests. You and the other team will be ping-ponging back and forth over Github/Hipchat.

## Some rules
- You **cannot** communicate with the other team in any way outside of the tests/code, including code comments. Let the assertions and the source code tell the story.
- You **cannot** write code that goes beyond the test (don't try to "guess" what the code should be). Write the most minimal code to pass the test.
- You **cannot** deliver code with failing tests.
- You **cannot** refactor your code until all tests are passing.

## Instructions

1. Create a Github repository for you and your partner
2. Add yourselves AND the other pair as collaborators to your repository
3. Setup [Github hooks to integrate with HipChat](http://help.hipchat.com/knowledgebase/articles/64389-github-integration), so that you don't need to manually notify the other team each time you push new code. Your HipChat API Token available on the [Phase 3 Guide](http://github.com/otter-2014/phase-3-guide).
