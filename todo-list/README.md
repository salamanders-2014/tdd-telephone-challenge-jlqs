# TDD Telephone - Todo List

## Description:

Create classes modeling a basic todo list app.

## Requirements:

- A task should have attributes `title`, `description`, `status` (either incomplete or complete), and a `created_at` timestamp
- A task's default status is "incomplete"
- A task's created_at timestamp should be automatically set on initialization
- A task should have a method `mark_as_complete!` which sets its status to complete
- A task should have a method `mark_as_incomplete!` which sets its status to incomplete
- A task should have a method `complete?` which returns a boolean indicating whether or not it has been completed
- A todo list should have a title
- A todo list has many tasks
- Tasks can be added to the todo list using a method `add_task(task)`
- A todo list has a method `complete_all!` which marks all of its tasks as complete
- A todo list has a method `complete?` which returns a boolean indicating whether or not all of its tasks have been completed
- A todo list has a method `completed_tasks` which returns an array of its completed tasks
- A todo list has a method `incomplete_tasks` which returns an array of its incompleted tasks
